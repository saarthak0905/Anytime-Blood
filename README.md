# Anytime-Blood
This is a mediating website where NGOs can successfully host blood donation camps and related awareness events etc. while individuals can keep track of these events and register for them.
They can also withdraw from the event by the click of a button before the event starts. The NGOs can either delete their existing events or  view participant details of their current event
